## Description
Through the use of Node.js a command line takes in user responses to dynamically generate a web page displaying engineer team members. This project was an assigment from the Georgia Tech Full Stack Development bootcamp to expand on understanding of Node.js, Node Package Manager & test driven development. 

This project provides a great example of using the CLI to generate classes which then dynamically generate new web content easily & efficiently. What I love practicing and learning the most during this project was how to properly use async/await to avoid a very miniversion of callback hell & how returns can be used in place of variables to also avoid asynchronicity.

## Installation
